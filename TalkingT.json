The sites that can be entered in this command in Minecraft, they are: \n Buried treasure \n Desert_Pyramid \n EndCity \n Fortress \n Igloo \n Jungle_Pyramid \n Chateau \n Mine mine \n Monument \n Ocean_Ruine \n Pillager_Outpost \n Shipwreck \n Bastion \n Swamp_Hut \n Town",

Therefore, it is convenient to know what these options or levels are, and then use the desired one in each specific case: \n Game modes \n / game mode 0: Go to survival mode \n / game mode 1: Switch to creation mode \n / game mode 2: Enter adventure mode \n / game mode 3: Switch to spectator mode \n Difficulty \n / peaceful difficulty: Pacific Mode \n / easy difficulty: Easy mode \n / normal difficulty: Normal mode \n / hard difficulty: Hard mode",

There are spikes that will make it take longer to get blocks, so the process may take too long. On the other hand, to create blocks of a mineral, you need several units, and you can also create ingots with them. \n Some main materials that we can find or use in Minecraft are: \n rock \n Coal \n Drink \n gold \n Esmeralda \n diamond (Be careful, because they only give the material if you chop with an iron spike.

The fuel that we will need to light it and heat it is placed in the lower tray of it and in the upper tray the food. This oven will not only be used for cooking things, because in Minecraft we can also cook our own food, like cooking meat. In addition, we also have all kinds of different recipes, like to be able to make bread and many other things, by mixing ingredients. So we can cook a lot of our food this way.",

        "text": "Minecraft is the second most popular video game in the world: in February 2017, it sold 121 million copies. \n But Minecraft is more than just a multiplayer game. It is also a tool for teaching children to code, an open platform enriched by mod development and it is the competition point of an international community of creators. \n If you're new to Minecraft, the best way to get started is to buy the game and get started. You can even use Minecraft Realms to create your own world - it's a kind of Minecraft host and a lightweight alternative to creating your own private server. \n But if you want the full Minecraft experience, you can take it a step further by launching your own private Minecraft server. With a private server, you are free to create a Minecraft world of your own. \n In this article, we'll show you exactly how. We will see how to create a Minecraft server on a Windows computer, on a Mac, and on a Linux hosting service.\n Ready ? Let's go. \n How to Create a Minecraft Server on Microsoft Windows, Mac, and Linux \n Basically, creating Minecraft servers follows a few basic steps: \n Install the latest version of Java \n Install the latest version of Minecraft server software \n Configure your server and network \n Start the server \n Check that access to your server is possible \n What you need to understand before you get started. \n Setting up a server takes time and effort. You will need some technical knowledge to set up a Minecraft server properly. \n You need to understand the basics of network computing concepts as they are essential to the management of any type of server. \n To be more specific, you should know and be comfortable with: \n The command line \n Networks (IP, DHCP, ports) \n Your system configuration \n Your network configuration \n The configuration of your router (for home installations) \n Running a Minecraft server at home? \n For running a Minecraft game server, a desktop computer is ideal. You don't need an intel xeon processor and an 8TB hdd ... \n On the other hand, to run a Minecraft server and a Minecraft client on the same machine, you need powerful configurations: CPU, RAM, SSD, hard disks, storage space, etc. This is especially true if you are going to install a lot of mods. \n Finally, make sure that your server is connected over Ethernet and not over Wi-Fi. Wired connections are more reliable. \n What if you don't want to host your server at home? \n A physical server hosted in your home exposes your home network to the world. \n If you prefer to avoid taking this risk, you can also resort to a Minecraft server host. Hosts require monthly or yearly payments, but you save yourself the tedious management of server hardware. \n If you are just starting out, a GoDaddy VPS server (shared hosting) will suit your needs. VPS can be managed by you or by GoDaddy. However, remember that with virtualization, you will be sharing hardware with other users. So monitor the use of resources. \n If you need a little more oomph, so that a lot of players can connect, a dedicated hosting might serve you better. GoDaddy Dedicated Servers offer protection against DDoS attacks and work with cPanel or Plesk on CentOS distributions. \n \n ",

To raise awareness of the decline of coral reefs, the game launched a pack of skins for a charity.
